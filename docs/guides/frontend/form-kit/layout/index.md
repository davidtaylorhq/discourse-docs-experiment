# Layout

Form Kit aims to provide good defaults, allowing you to mainly use fields and controls. However, if you need more control, we provide several helpers: [Row and Col](./row-col), [Section](./section), [Fieldset](./fieldset), [Container](/container) and [Actions](./actions).

You can also use utilities like [Submit](./submit), [Reset](./reset), [Alert](./alert) and [InputGroup](/input-group).
