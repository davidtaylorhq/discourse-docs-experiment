# Submit

The `Submit` component renders a `<DButton />` which will submit the form when clicked. It accepts all the same parameters as a standard `<DButton />`. The label, default action, and primary style are set by default.

**Example**

```hbs
<form.Submit />
```

To customize the `Submit` button further, you can pass additional parameters as needed:

**Example with Additional Parameters**

```hbs
<form.Submit @translatedLabel="Send" />
```
